    review: `Josh was awesome! He came and knew what was instantly wrong with my vehicle after getting the run around from Jiffy Lube. I had the mass air flow sensor replaced by Jiffy Lube who damaged my air intake valve. I drove down the street to get my inspection done but instead my check engine light came on and was told system too lean. Too much air was getting into my engine. I kept contacting Jiffy Lube 620 & Round Rock who said the part was bad. My mechanic kept telling me to reset the ECU because it was giving false readings. I told my mechanic I think something else is wrong with my car and gave him the new info from my Jiffy Lube. I almost paid $323 to get this done if it wasn't for Josh coming out and seeing the hose was damaged which matched the paperwork from the Jiffy Lube by my house. I would've been out of hundreds of dollars. I ordered the part from Amazon. Josh installed the part for me at a great price. I'm investigator for the state of Texas. Now Jiffy Lube wants to make things right. Too late. I already made a case file against them.`,

    review: `I recently had my water pump and serpentine belt replaced, and the experience was absolutely excellent. The mechanic did a phenomenal job from start to finish. He was professional, knowledgeable, and took the time to explain everything clearly. The work was done quickly, the quality was top-notch, and the price was incredibly fair—especially considering the level of service. It’s rare to find someone this reliable and skilled, and I couldn’t be happier with the results. I highly recommend him to anyone needing automotive repairs. I’ll definitely be returning for any future work!`,

    review: `First time going with ATX mobile, and they were nothing short of greatness. From communication, Josh was upfront with the service and told me the possible issues. He gave me a quote that was exact for the service when completed. He sent David out and he got my spark plugs done in a reasonable amount of time. He answered all of my concerns and checked the rest of my vehicles condition. I will definitely use them for future car repairs.`,
